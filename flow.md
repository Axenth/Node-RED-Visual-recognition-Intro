# Step 3 - Build the flow

1. Drag an `inject file node` onto the canvas.
2. Repeat this with a `debug node` and a `visual recognition node`.
3. Wire them together: first the inject file node, then the visual recognition node and then the debug node.
4. Open the debug node, by double clicking, change the output into `msg.result`.
5. Open the Visual Recognition node, and select `English`.
6. Click on `Deploy` and then on the small triangle just under the hambrurger menu in the top right section of the screen and select `Debug messages`.
